# activedirectory
 This project is used to empower the ad usage and provide insights for your active directory environment

Goal:
 The goal of this project is to ensure that users/security responders to effectively use this project for getting insights but more importantly for taking appropriate actions on ad objects where possible.

What was done so far:
Ability to fetch the active directory list when the code is run on a local computer when provided the right credentials.

This project can be only tested when you have an active directory environment. I will be more than happy to attach the hyper -v disk so you can clone if needed for testing your environment, when the AD was setup with few users. Please request it via issues.


 To Do:

> Build API's - will need to figure out the best way to do this.
> Identify the database used for storing any operations performed via api as a reference log for   tracking and internal reference while we respond to incidents.
> Ability to properly structure the code and maintain the repository to be usable.
> Provide an ideal scenario how to deploy this and deployment files if any to properly leverage

Current Features:
> Will add soon

About me:
I will be the maintainer and contributer for this project until I figure out the time that I will need to spend and what needs to be done.
I know a little about git and github to get started but may have the contributers provide more feedback on this project and how best to maintain. You are all awesome. 

Thank you so much for taking your time to read this. Hope this helps and looking forward to some active contributers for this project to help and build the open source security team.
